# examples-ai-beckrock-agent-national-parks
This repository demonstrates how to build and deploy an AI agent using Amazon Bedrock and AWS Lambda, with infrastructure managed by AWS CDK in TypeScript. The AI agent is designed to interact with the National Park Service (NPS) API to fetch information about national parks based on user input, such as a state code.
